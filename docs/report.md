A project by Baptiste Fontaine, David Galichet and Julien Sagot.

## General notes

### Portability

This project aim at being compatible with any UNIX system, conforming the norm
POSIX-???. We did not use Linux specific functions, or provided an alternative
if so.

## Dazibao and TLV APIs

We designed these APIs as an object-oriented structure for the purpose of being
idependant of the implementation. A programm using the Dazibao (or TLV) API
does not have to know about the structure used, and the Dazibao API does not
have to know how a TLV actually is represented.

## User Interfaces

### Command-Line Interface

### Web Server

We implemented a Web server to have a more user-friendly interface to a
Dazibao. It serves it as an HTML page, and allows the user to interact with it
using AJAX request.

#### Features

- Compact a Dazibao, remove a TLV, add a text TLV
- Get notifications when the Dazibao changes
- Static files are served from a `public_html` directory

#### Limitations

- The server is synchronous and mono-threaded
- Only a subset of HTTP 1.0 is supported. We implemented only features we need
  for this project.
- `POST` query parameters cannot contain quotes (`"`)
- multiple files in a `POST` request are not supported
- `GET` query parameters are not supported

## Notifications

### Notification server

Until [4e5562e](4e5562e28d15ed8013407136ed62125a16d6686d), we used signals to
notify change on file. The plan was:
* one process per file
* one process per client connection
* Once a process watching a file see a modification, it sends a SIGUSR1 to all
  processes in groupid. Then:
  * Processes watching files ignore this signal
  * Processes managing clients find the file name correponding to the process
    who sent the signal (`si_pid`), and write notification on its socket.

The good side:
* Different processes means that if one fail, others still work and do not
  care.
* It is easy to broadcast a signal to a whole group id.

The bad side:
* If a signal is sent more than one time before entering handler, only one
  signal will be delivered.
* This issue could have been resolved with real-time signals, but we would
  loose the broadcasting ability of "normal" signals.

#### Known issues
* As default file watching is based on `ctime` of files, it can notify false
  modification, or miss some of them.  This choice have been made to save
  ressources avoiding file parsing.  Not a real issue since you can enable the
  *reliable mode* with `--reliable` option.

### Notification client

#### Known issues

* Notifications longer than `BUFFER_SIZE` will not be read

* System call (notifier command length + message length + title length) to
  notify user longer than `BUFFER_SIZE * 2` will not work properly.
